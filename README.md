# Karabiner Configs

This is some of my personal Karabiner configs, highly opinionated.

See also [MOZGIII/karabiner-input-switch](https://github.com/MOZGIII/karabiner-input-switch).

## Usage

1. Install Karabiner.

2. ```shell
   cp *.json ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/
   ```

3. Enable what you prefer at Karabiner's complex modifications settings.

4. Apply further configuration if needed (i.e. at keyboard settings).
